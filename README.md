# custom-dc-invite
a little project to make custom discord invites over a url

## how it works
you create a account for free on https://replit.com and create a repl put the code inside and replace the text YOUR DC INVITE with your discord invite (it works best with an infinit invite) then run the repl and you just can use the url which will be displayed and who ever clicks on the invite will be invited to your server
